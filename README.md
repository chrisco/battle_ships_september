#BattleShips

The game is ready to play when theres are two players initialized with a board each and each board has 5 ships placed.

By default it is player1's go first and after each shot it will switch the turns until there is a winner.

A game_setup.rb file has been added which sets up the game to a ready state placeing each ship from colums A through to E vertically.

## UPDATE

After starting this project, we decided to use a different versioin of the Battleship game, but did not change the name of the project.  The version of the game that we are using is from here: https://github.com/stephenlloyd/battleships-march
